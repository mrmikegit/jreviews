I was lucky to get a same day appointment today after 24hrs of neck/back spasm and KAI saved the day! Feeling so much better after 90 minutes\u2026 I would highly recommend Kai!",

I felt very comfortable with her and after my deep tissue massage there was a noticeable decrease in my pain. Can\u2019t wait to go back! Very reasonable prices too.",
